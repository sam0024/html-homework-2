          <li>The Origin of Demons: Muzan is the first demon, having gained his powers through a unique<br> transformation. His existence is the reason for the demon plague that afflicts humanity, making<br> him the source of the problems faced by the protagonists. He directly opposes the main character,<br> Tanjiro Kamado, and his allies. Muzan’s actions set the stage for their journey, as they seek to<br> eliminate demons and find a cure for Tanjiro’s sister, who has been turned into a demon. Muzan <br>is highly intelligent and strategic, often manipulating others to achieve his goals. He uses <br>subordinates, like the Twelve Kizuki, to carry out his plans while maintaining a sense of distance<br> and control. His character explores themes of power, immortality, and the consequences of one’s<br> choices. Muzan’s relentless pursuit of perfection and control highlights the darkness that can<br> arise from ambition. Through his actions and the challenges he poses, Muzan pushes the<br> heroes to grow, evolve, and confront their own fears and limitations.
